# Types of chatbots
# 1. Flow based chatbots(No ML Required) : These chatbots use a set of rules i.e. The user don't have the freedom to type in the commands. There are set of speech you can give the bots, based on which the bot can give answers.
# 2. NLP Based flow chatbots : These chatbots give freedom to the user to type in their desired question based on which our model will give answers, but the questions must be related to the platform or the enquiries they are currently talking about.
# 3. Open-Ended chatbots : These chatbots can be asked any form of question or can have any type of conversation with them. Eg :: ChatGPT.

# For creating ML/NLP chatbots we have two methods ::
# 1. Using a chatbot framework, such as Dialogflow by google, IBM Watson Assistant, Amazon Lex e.t.c.
# 2. Using custom implementation by using OpenAI api, GPT3/4, LLMs, BERT, Hugging face bloom e.t.c.
